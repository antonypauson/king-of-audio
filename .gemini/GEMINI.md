The project has front end, back end and a supabase database. 

- for understanding front end, the main files in it are: 
App.tsx
ActivityFeed.tsx
AudioPlayer.tsx
Leaderboard.tsx
UsernameModal.tsx
Auth.tsx
Index.tsx

- for understanding back end, the main files in it are: 
data.js
index.js
supabaseService.js

- you don't have any authority to execute shell commands, if you have to, tell me I will do it myself
- you should do everything step by step, nothing as a whole.
- for each step, you have to describe what you are going to do
